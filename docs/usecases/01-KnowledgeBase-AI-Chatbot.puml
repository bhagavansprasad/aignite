You asked me to make changes, but you didn't specify what changes you wanted. I assume you meant you wanted the diagram to reflect the shortened aliases you used for the participants (UI, Logic, Base, Storage). Here's the updated PlantUML code:

@startuml
title Sequence Diagram - Knowledge Base & AI Chatbot

actor User
participant AIgnite as UI
participant Chatbot as Logic
participant Knowledge as Base
database Document as Storage

User -> UI: Asks Question via Chatbot
activate UI

UI -> Logic: Sends Question
activate Logic

Logic -> Base: Searches for Relevant Information
activate Base

Base -> Storage: Retrieves Relevant Document Chunks
activate Storage

Storage --> Base: Returns Document Chunks
deactivate Storage

Base --> Logic: Returns Relevant Information
deactivate Base

Logic -> Logic: Processes Information (AI Inference)
activate Logic

Logic --> UI: Returns Answer
deactivate Logic

UI --> User: Displays Answer
deactivate UI

User -> UI: Uploads Document
activate UI

UI -> Base: Sends Document
activate Base

Base -> Storage: Stores Document
activate Storage

Storage --> Base: Confirmation
deactivate Storage

Base --> UI: Confirmation
deactivate Base

UI --> User: Confirmation
deactivate UI

Changes Made:

The participant aliases have been used throughout the diagram:

AIgnite UI is now UI

Chatbot Logic is now Logic

Knowledge Base is now Base

Document Storage is now Storage

The functionality and flow of the diagram remain exactly the same. Only the participant names in the diagram code have been shortened.
