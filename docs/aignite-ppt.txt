I can't directly *create* a PPT or animated video in a visual sense, as I'm a text-based AI. Generating those kinds of files is beyond my capabilities. However, I can give you a detailed storyboard and script for both a PowerPoint presentation and an animated video that you can then use to create them yourself, or to give to a designer/animator.
