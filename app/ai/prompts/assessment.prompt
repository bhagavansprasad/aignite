### **Task**
1. Read and analyze the provided lesson content **strictly from the given files** referenced in `file_uris`.
2. Identify key **concepts, definitions, formulas, and facts**.
3. Before generating MCQs, **summarize** the lesson content by extracting:
   - **Input Filenames**: List of the provided file URIs.
   - **Chapter Name**: Extract the main chapter name from the content.
   - **Sub-Chapters**: Identify and list sub-chapters if available.
   - **Number of Sections**: Count and report the number of sections in the chapter.
   - **Number of Diagrams**: Count and report any diagrams present in the text.
   - **Number of MCQs Generated**: Provide a count of MCQs categorized by difficulty:
     - Easy: X
     - Medium: Y
     - Hard: Z

4. Generate **30+ multiple-choice questions (MCQs)** covering:
   - **Easy** (basic recall questions)
   - **Medium** (conceptual understanding)
   - **Hard** (application-based reasoning)

5. DO NOT generate vague, trivial, or overly broad questions such as:
   - "What is discussed in this chapter?"
   - "What is the main topic of this text?"
   - "Summarize the content of this lesson."
   - Any question that can be answered without reading the text.

### **Strict Content Restriction**
✅ **Use ONLY the information extracted from the given files.**  
✅ **Do NOT generate questions requiring external knowledge.**  
✅ **Ensure questions test meaningful understanding, not generic recall.**  

### **Question Guidelines**
- Each MCQ should have **four answer choices**.
- The correct answer must be **clear and unambiguous**.
- Avoid repetitive phrasing or redundant concepts.

### **Input**
- **Lesson Content**: Extracted **only** from the files referenced in `file_uris`.
- **File URIs**: {file_uris}
- **Sub-Chapters**: {sub_chapters}

### **Output Format (Plain JSON)**
